Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created all of the characters, the backgrounds, and the sprites to make the textbox, main menu, and more. I have navigated renpy and learned how to make a visual novel game. I started writing the script for the characters. I not only have each character but I also have multiple versions of them for every emotion. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not coded all the script. That's all that's left to do. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

It was difficult to try and make characters from scratch so I finally found characters I could download. I had a little issue trying to figure out how to create different options to select in renpy and I finally figured that out and now I can create the different story lines that I had originally wanted.
